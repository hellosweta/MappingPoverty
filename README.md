# Mapping Poverty
How are the demographics of poverty changing? [*Mapping Poverty*](https://swetagsanghavi.github.io/MappingPoverty/) is a visual exploration of the US census data on poverty by county over time.

## About
Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) is published by the US Census Bureau by combining data from administrative records, postcensal population estimates, and the decennial census with direct estimates from the American Community Survey. County estimates were collected from 2012 to 2015 and mapped on a choropleth to visualize what happens to impoverished counties over time.
